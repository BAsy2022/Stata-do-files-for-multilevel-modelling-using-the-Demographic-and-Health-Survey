This repository provides Stata code for performing multilevel modeling using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data. Multilevel modeling is a statistical technique used for analyzing data that have a hierarchical structure. DHS data often include such structures, for example, individuals nested within households or communities. This repository aims to facilitate the analysis of such data by providing a step-by-step guide and Stata code templates.
